### Arguments, debate points and discussion on morality of Immigration

Various points such as the following are used in right wing idelogy for immigration laws which lead to discrimination or unjust treatment of immigrants:  

1. We built this country for our people.
2. Our goverment made a deal with the migrant. The migrant willingly accepted the terms of the deal while immigrating to our country.
3. We owe to our country.
4. People of our country come first.

   All of these points fail the test of "All men are equal". This is one of the fundamental concepts of Morality which is agreed by most of the major religions such as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Bhudism etc.

   Another important consideration is practicallity. The modern world constitues of countries and it is practically not possible to make every man(person) equal, so there has to be sacrifices made in morality. But, the problem is that this argument is used as a cover for making discriminatory and immoral laws, E.g. child slavery by Apple in China is a perfect example. The practicalitarian's argument is that if they don't provide those children jobs then they would die of starvation anyway, so we are doing a net positive moral deed. In reality, what is being done is ***exploitation*** and ***discrimination***. Why are the people of their own coutry given same child labour laws and wages. Why not let them die too or suffer the same living conditions and laws. For true morality those children in China and children of the provide rconutry should treated as equal. In this book, I will explain in detail how various laws and policies used by countires for immigrants are actually a form of exploitation and unjust.

Philosophically, immigration raises complex questions about rights, justice, and the role of the state, with arguments ranging from open borders based on freedom of movement to the right of states to control their borders for cultural or economic reasons. 
Here's a deeper dive into some key philosophical perspectives on immigration:
Arguments for Open Borders:

    Freedom of Movement:
