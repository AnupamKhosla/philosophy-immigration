Punjab == Punjab_Suba

When we say X people are Y, we mean 90% plus of X.

Punjabi do Ielts exam, B no Punjabi exam.
Punjabi pay tens of thousand of dollars, B pay no money.
Punjabis are graduates, B are 5 grade fail.
Punjabi improve low population in west, B worsen population crisis. Ludhiana sah lena okha hoya piya.
During pak war 2025 and flood, B ran away back.
Punjabis do Langar and social help for B, B never organise langar in Punjab. They take from our economy, but don't give back.
Punjabis/Indians oversease, e.g. America make more than average American.
In Ludhiana railway station 99% criminal are B. Punjabi oversease have lower crime rate per capita than average Canadian.
Hdi, crime rate per capita, education etc etc.
Basically Punjabis give their top cream to Canada, B give their bottom left over, not IAS from Bihar.
Indo-Canadians are close to 2 million in number and have a significantly lower crime crate than average white Canadians as well as having the highest average personal income in Canada as they also do in the US
Punjabi language and culture.
Population problem.

Do you see the population crisis we are in. This near my house Basti Jodhewal Ludhiana. We Punjabi's have been having 1-2 kids since 90s. Why are we taking the burden of other state's illiteracy of having 10 kids.
Do you believe Punjab has the right to exist?
Do you believe Punjab has the right to defend it's language, heritage and culture.
Do you think B's are causing population crisis in Punjab and Ludhiana specifically?
Do you think Punjab has the right to decide it's land and property owning policies like Himachal?
Do you think, like we have reservation on the basis of caste, Punjab has the right to decide it's demographic by assigning jobs to only Punjabi speaking people, e.g. municipal jobs.
Do you think Punjabis have the right to discuss amongst themself about the migration and population crisis?
