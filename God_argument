## God Argument

There are phenomena beyond human understanding—potentially pointing to super-consciousness, God, duality, or a deeper nature of the universe.
Concepts saved for future reference:

1. Descartes' mind-body problem and duality principle.
2. Wave function collapse on observation; quantum double-slit experiment and consciousness.
3. Quantum bomb experiment.
4. Delayed choice quantum eraser experiment.
5. Special relativity: time dilation, length contraction.
6. General relativity. -- the fact that the maths is so accurate to 
7. Ant colonies exhibiting group consciousness.
8. DMT-induced 'God-like' experiences.
9. Personal anecdote: individual X called during Y desease episode, coinciding with their dream of the user in hospital with exact Y pain.
Other telepathic experiences.

Wigner was astonished that abstract mathematics, created purely by human thought with no concern for reality, so perfectly describes the physical universe. He called this fit “unreasonable” — meaning it seems too perfect to be explained by chance.

“The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.”

### DMT  
According to a transcript of his episode with Andrew Gallimore (#2403) the guest explains that during a DMT experience the brain appears to move from the ordinary waking world model → a more disordered state → then collapses into a new type of order, i.e. constructing “an entirely different model of reality”.

### Richard Feynman
Physicist Richard Feynman once marveled that quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts the magnetic moment of the electron with such precision that it’s “like measuring the distance between New York and Los Angeles to within the width of a human hair.” QED’s predictions agree with experiment to better than one part in a hundred million, the most precise alignment between theory and measurement in all of science. This astonishing harmony exemplifies what Eugene Wigner called “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.” Such perfection seems far beyond coincidence — as if the universe itself were written in an elegant mathematical language. Whether one names this hidden order God, Nature, or pure mathematics, it suggests, as Wigner implied, that reality and mind share a common structure, and that through mathematics, humanity briefly glimpses the architecture of creation itself.
